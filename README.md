# Comparison Phenotype Prediction

## Introduction
..... all models were run using easyPheno (CITE).

## Simulations
We generated synthetic phenotypes using the notebook simulations.ipynb. All Simulations including the SNP ids for the causal SNPs and background SNPs as well as their effect sizes can be found in the Simulations folder

## GWAS
We performed GWAS for four phenotypes of *Arabidopsis thaliana* using permGWAS (CITE). The GWAS results can be found in the GWAS_results folder.

## Feature importance
The folder Results contains the results of our feature importance analysis

## Plots
The notebook .....plots.ipynb contains the code to reproduce all plots which were shown in the publication.
